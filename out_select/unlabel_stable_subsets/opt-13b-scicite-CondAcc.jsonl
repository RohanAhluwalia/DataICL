This task creates a recurrent need for pairs of participants to produce location descriptions. These descriptions can be reliably classified into four broad categories (see below). Alignment of the category of description used by participants can then be used as an index of semantic coordination (Garrod and Anderson, 1987; Garrod and Doherty, 1994).
